# FiftyOne Tests

FiftyOne currently uses both
[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) and
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable) to implement its tests.

## Running tests

To run all unit tests, execute:

```shell
pytest unittests/
```

To run a specific test, execute:

```shell
pytest unittests/<file>.py
```

To run a specific test case, execute:

```shell
pytest unittests/<file>.py -s -k <test_function_name>
```

The `-s` flag is optional and prints all stdout from the test case.
